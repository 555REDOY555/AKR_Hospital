Typically this provider acts as the first contact and principal point of continuing care for patients within a healthcare system, and coordinates other specialist care that the patient may need.[1][2][3] Patients commonly receive primary care from professionals such as a primary care physician (general practitioner or family physician), a physician assistant, or a nurse practitioner. In some localities, such a professional may be a registered nurse, a pharmacist, a clinical officer (as in parts of Africa), or an Ayurvedic or other traditional medicine professional (as in parts of Asia). Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may then be referred for secondary or tertiary care.",

In contrast, health psychology represents a stronger emphasis specifically on psychology's role in both behavioral medicine and behavioral health.",
